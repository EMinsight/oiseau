**oiseau** is a specialized **Discontinuous Galerkin Time-Domain (DGTD)**
framework designed for advanced simulation of electromagnetic and wave
propagation problems. This modular and research-oriented tool aims to support a
wide range of complex materials, including dispersive and anisotropic media.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**
> oiseau is still under active development. APIs, features, and interfaces may evolve quickly.

## ✨ Features (Planned)

- Modular DGTD core
- Support for dispersive materials via ADE models
- Anisotropic and doubly dispersive media handling
- Vector fitting and complex pole-residue modeling
- Future support for scripting interfaces (e.g., Python)
