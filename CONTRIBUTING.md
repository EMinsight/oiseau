Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the Conventional Commits format:

Common types:
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: Adding or fixing tests
- chore: Maintenance tasks (e.g., tooling, CI, build scripts)

Examples:
  git commit -m "feat(solver): add ADE model for dispersive media"
  git commit -m "fix(mesh): resolve issue with element connectivity"
  git commit -m "docs: update README with installation instructions"
